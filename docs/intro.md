# Infinite Client

Lightweight Fabric utility client for Minecraft 1.21.10 with a clean, minimal interface.

## What is Infinite Client?

- Focused feature set for building, movement, combat, and visibility assists.
- Fabric-based (`loader 0.17.x`, `fabric-api 0.135.0+1.21.10`), so it stays close to vanilla performance.
- Simple UI and sensible defaults that avoid clutter.

> Use the client responsibly and follow the rules of the servers you join.

## Quick Start

1. Install the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) for Minecraft `1.21.10`.
2. Add the matching [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) to your `mods` folder.
3. Drop the latest Infinite Client jar from the [Downloads page](/downloads) into `.minecraft/mods`.
4. Launch the game with the Fabric profile and open the Infinite Client menu to toggle modules.
