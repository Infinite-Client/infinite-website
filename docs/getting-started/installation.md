# Installation

Infinite Client runs on Minecraft Java Edition `1.21.10` with Fabric.

## Requirements

- Minecraft `1.21.10` (Java Edition)
- Fabric Loader `0.17.x` or newer
- [Fabric API 0.135.0+1.21.10](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)

## Install Steps

1. Download and run the [Fabric installer](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) and pick the `1.21.10` profile.
2. Drop `fabric-api-0.135.0+1.21.10.jar` into `.minecraft/mods`.
3. Drop the latest Infinite Client jar from the [Downloads page](/downloads) into `.minecraft/mods`.
4. Launch the game with the Fabric profile. You should see Infinite Client listed on the title screen mods list.

## Updating

- Replace the existing `infinite-*.jar` in `.minecraft/mods` with the newest release.
- Keep Fabric Loader and Fabric API on the matching `1.21.10` versions to avoid crashes or missing mixins.

## Uninstalling

- Remove the Infinite Client jar from `.minecraft/mods`.
- If you added extra helper mods for Infinite Client, remove those as well.
