# Using the Client

Infinite Client aims to stay simple: enable only what you need and keep the screen clean.

## Opening the menu

- Open Minecraft and join a world or server.
- Use the keybinding shown under `Options → Controls → Key Binds → Infinite Client` to open the client menu.
- Rebind the menu key here if it conflicts with another mod.

## Toggling modules

- Modules are grouped by purpose (movement, combat, building, rendering).
- Click a module to toggle it on/off. Some modules expose sliders or toggles for fine tuning.
- Start with a single module at a time to learn how it affects your world and movement.

## Profiles & presets

- Keep a lightweight set of modules active for survival and another for building.
- When switching servers, double-check any automated combat or block placement features against their rules.

## Troubleshooting

- Nothing happens when toggling a module: confirm you are on the Fabric `1.21.10` profile with Fabric API installed.
- Keybind conflicts: clear duplicate keybinds in the vanilla settings or in other mods.
- Rendering glitches: disable conflicting visual mods (e.g., other fullbright/x-ray style tweaks) and restart.
