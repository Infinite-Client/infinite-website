# Modules Overview

Current and planned modules are grouped below so you can see what the client focuses on. Many are intentionally minimal and ship with only the core options needed to stay lightweight.

## Building & blocks

- **EasyBridge** — Auto-places blocks ahead while you sprint to keep a bridge going. Adjustable range.
- **FastPlace / FastBreak** — Reduce placement delay and increase mining speed with simple sliders.
- **SmoothStackUp** — Places blocks under you for clean tower builds.
- **AutoBuild / AutoFill** — Build from a blueprint or fill a marked region with a chosen block.
- **FreeBuild** — Loosen placement restrictions for creative-style building.

## Movement

- **AirFlyer** — Elytra- and bucket-assisted flight with speed control.
- **AntiFall** — Prevent fall damage with water or other mitigations.
- **AnyWaySprint / AutoSprint / AutoSneak** — Keep sprinting in any direction and auto-sneak on block edges.
- **AutoSwitch / AutoTool** — Swap to the right tool or weapon for what you target.
- **FastMove** — Boost base movement speed.

## Combat

- **ArmorManage** — Auto-equip the best armor available.
- **AutoBlock / AutoShield** — Block or shield when threatened.
- **AutoCritical** — Time jumps for more frequent crits.
- **AutoTotem** — Swap in a totem when health drops under a threshold.
- **AutoLeave** — Disconnect when a safety rule is triggered (e.g., low health).
- **Combat assists** — InFightAssist/OutFightAssist for melee or ranged support, plus hotbar quality-of-life via ConvenientHotBar.

## Vision & awareness

- **FullBright** — Keep the world fully lit.
- **ESP tools** — ChestEsp, MobEsp, PlayerEsp, PortalEsp for seeing key entities through walls.
- **XRay** — Filter to only the blocks you care about (configurable block list).
- **FreeCamera / Camera distance/no-clip** — Detach the camera or adjust distance for scouting builds.
- **Radar** — Mini-map style overlay for nearby entities with configurable range.

## Tips

- Combine only the modules you need; running everything at once can make movement feel unnatural.
- When testing new modules, start in a single-player world to avoid tripping server-side protections.
- Keep your client updated — newer releases often include stability fixes for Fabric updates.
